You have to learn at least one of the two languages (<a href=\"https://dustri.org/b/my-favourite-c-footgun.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">which already takes quite some time and effort</a>) and how the surrounding ecosystem works. Even building a project is non-trivial if you’re not already familiar with Make, CMake, Ninja, Autotools, etc; and that’s just the entry point to systems programming.</p>\n<p>Compare this to learning, say, JavaScript. While far from perfect, JS is easier to learn, build and distribute. The ecosystem is still messy but it’s undeniable that it’s more newbie-friendly than C/C++, and once you learn JS you can do web development (backend included, using Node), write desktop apps (Electron), mobile apps (React Native), video games (Unity) and more. Why work harder to get access to a smaller pool of potential jobs when JS and web development open so many doors?</p>\n<p><strong>Some consider this the ultimate proof of contemporary decadence of software engineering, but that’s simply the structure of economic incentives that we built for ourselves</strong>: for most people learning a high level language opens more career possibilities than learning C and, even when one wants to branch out, it’s still more useful careerwise to learn Kubernetes than it is to learn CMake. </p>\n<p>Instead of just complaining, we should think of ways to induce the change we want to see in our industry, and that starts by acknowledging that <strong>people today really need to go out of their way to learn systems programming and, in doing so, they have to deal with a lot of bad accidents of history</strong>. Until we improve this situation, I don’t think we can expect anything else to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rewrite-it-in-rust\"><a href=\"#rewrite-it-in-rust\" aria-label=\"rewrite it in rust permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Rewrite it in Rust</h3>\n<p>The RIIR mantra has been floating around for a while by now. It has been repeated <a href=\"https://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/rewrite-everything-in-rust.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">with full conviction</a> by some, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X7ny7Qrsbd8?t=5391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">used to mock Rust by others</a>. I’m not a fan of the mocking, but at the same time <strong>I’m not convinced either that RIIR (or RIIZ for that matter) is the solution to our problems</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rewriting every C/C++ project would surely help bypass some of the aforementioned accidents of history, but it would also take an amount of effort that I doubt the FOSS community is able to put in. First of all, <strong><a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/whyc.html#why_isn_t_sqlite_coded_in_a_safe_language_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rewriting from scratch is hard</a></strong>: even the best projects will have undocumented and untested behavior, making it very hard to catch and fix regressions, and in the best case scenario you’ll produce a new implementation at best functionally equivalent to the old one, which is also why many rightfully consider full rewrites <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">an outright dangerous idea</a>.</p>\n<p>On top of that, <strong>the FOSS community will never converge to a single language</strong>, which means that a deliberate rewrite effort will be uncoordinated. We have already seen how disruptive changing language can be when the Python <code>cryptography</code> package added a Rust dependency which in turn <a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">changed the list of supported platforms</a> and caused a lot of community leaders to butt heads. <strong>To improve our critical infrastructure we must improve the developer experience (DX) of systems programming, but rewriting everything is not the only answer.</strong> </p>\n<p>Instead of running away from the C/C++ ecosystem, <strong>we must find a way of moving forward that doesn’t start by throwing in the trash everything that we have built in the last 40 years</strong>. C and C++ are still being moved forward by their respective committees, but progress has been really slow and very little of it has been made on the DX front. <strong>To trigger real change we need to act independently but in harmony with the C/C++ ecosystem, which is why Zig is not only a language, but also a toolchain that can compile C/C++ code</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improving-the-cc-ecosystem\"><a href=\"#improving-the-cc-ecosystem\" aria-label=\"improving the cc ecosystem permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Improving the C/C++ ecosystem</h2>\n<p>While LLVM is now <a href=\"https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-new-relationship-llvm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">transitioning into an optional dependency</a> in the Zig compiler, it will still be part of the 40mb archive you get when you download Zig as it’s very useful to deal with C/C++ code.
