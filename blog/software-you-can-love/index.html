If that sounds interesting already, you can find information about the location and ticket prices <a href=https://sycl.it>on the official website</a>.</p><h1 id=what-does-sycl-mean>What does SYCL mean?</h1><p>Software you can love is software whose <strong>main goal</strong> is to serve the end user, and it&rsquo;s alarming how rarely we get to deliver this kind of software professionally. I believe I&rsquo;m not alone in saying that there&rsquo;s pride and pleasure in creating software that others want to use because it solves a problem with elegance, so the big question is: how can we make more of that?</p><p>Conferences are financial ventures and their nature makes them extremely susceptible to hype cycles, but ultimately they exist to stimulate and disseminate ideas. You might be someone who doesn&rsquo;t go to conferences, but we all have learned at least something from a talk given at a conference held somewhere. And yet, while conferences can be a useful tool, I don&rsquo;t think the answer to the big question lies in microservices or any of the popular conference topics.</p><p>Sure, the problem of unlovable software is in good part technical in nature, but for example there&rsquo;s no technical limitation that forces the Twitter app to constantly ask me to enable notifications, with no way to permanently say no.</p><p><figure style=display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center><a href=fkn-twitter.jpeg target=_blank><img style=max-width:400px;width:100vw src=fkn-twitter.jpeg alt="Twitter app screenshot"></a><figcaption><i><small></small></i></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>I want SYCL to be a conference that tackles the problem of how to make more software you can love on all levels of abstraction</strong>: from technical topics, to understanding how business models impact software. Accepting a wide range of talk topics is nothing new, but I&rsquo;d like to stress once more that <strong>every topic of discussion is meant to inform our answer to the big question of how to create more software you can love</strong>.</p><p>This means that I will (probably) not accept talks about microservices not because I hate the practice or want to be a contrarian, but simply because I don&rsquo;t believe that more &ldquo;monoliths vs microservices&rdquo; discussions are going to make software <em>significantly</em> more lovable. Conversely, I would be more interested in a talk about how to improve native application toolchains, so that we can stop shipping Electron apps.</p><p>This last point is particularly relevant because <strong>the second question that I want to prioritize is how to make creating elegant solutions more enjoyable</strong>, so that we can improve our own experience as software developers. I don&rsquo;t believe in martyrdom, and so I don&rsquo;t expect anybody to become a human sacrifice in the name of making somebody else happy. This means that I don&rsquo;t blame developers that ship Electron applications because I know how convenient it can be.</p><p>That said, I would love for my desktop applications to be more conservative with resources and visually more consistent with the OS than what Electron allows, and I believe the only realistic way to achieve that goal is to make native development more compelling for the developer.</p><h1 id=software-that-serves-the-end-user-isnt-that-free-and-open-source-software>Software that serves the end user… isn&rsquo;t that Free and Open Source Software?</h1><p>I wish. Maybe it used to be, but I don&rsquo;t see modern FOSS as embodying these values anymore.</p><p>In the beginning Open Source was just a thing people did in their free time, so big tech didn&rsquo;t really care about it, but over time it became an unavoidable aspect of doing business. Want to build a new database or dev tool? Good luck getting any traction if it&rsquo;s not Open Source. And so big tech adapted and learned how to deal with the problem, to the point that Open Source is often used to implement a form of <a href=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/kayfabe>kayfabe</a>, <a href=https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/05/microsoft_net_foundation_under_fire/>layered on top</a> of a very dry set of rules for licensing software.</p><p>This is not to say that everything that brands itself as Open Source is bad of course, far from it, but &ldquo;Software You Can Love&rdquo; is an expression that I&rsquo;ve created explicitly to avoid feeding a brand that twists spontaneous collaboration into becoming <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/>a smokescreen for big tech&rsquo;s fight for dominance</a>.</p><p>In <em><a href=https://kristoff.it/blog/the-open-source-game/>Playing the Open Source Game</a></em> I&rsquo;ve talked at length about my experience with Open Source, but I elected to avoid spending words on the Free Software movement in it, which instead I&rsquo;m going to do now.</p><p>At its core, Free Software is a reasonable idea: the end user should be able to inspect, modify and redistribute the software they use. In practice most people don&rsquo;t know how nor care about reading the code of most programs they use, but I really wish that was the biggest problem with Free Software.</p><p>What I find appalling about the Free Software movement, is how tragicomically ineffective its leadership has been over the years. About one month ago Richard Stallman held &ldquo;<a href="https://lunduke.substack.com/p/richard-stallman-the-state-of-the?s=r">The state of the Free Software movement</a>&rdquo; and really gave a good display of the quality of their advocacy work: first he complained about Ubuntu not being free enough, then pointed out that it&rsquo;s ethically wrong to play non-free online videogames, and finally announced a new GNU C manual.</p><p>It&rsquo;s unacceptable to me how nonchalantly you are being asked to make sacrifices (never use any proprietary software ever!) by people who think that a new GNU C manual is exactly what we need to improve the state of software. Users need to be protected from hostile design, but the solution is not retreating to a free software monastery to study the (GNU C manual) book.</p><h1 id=in-conclusion>In conclusion</h1><p>If you too think that there&rsquo;s an important quality often missing from both proprietary software and modern FOSS, then <a href=https://sycl.it>join us this October for the first ever SYCL in-person event</a>.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, SYCL is not a user experience conference. UX is in scope, but far from being the only focus. Going back to the Twitter app example, a product manager greenlit the design decision to make it impossible to permanently turn off the popup. In all likelihood, that product manager knew perfectly well that it&rsquo;s a dark pattern, which means that discussions about UX are not enough to push back against this kind of behavior.</p><p>Above I described software you can love as <em>software whose main goal is to serve the end user</em>, but I don&rsquo;t believe this description to be complete. There&rsquo;s more to software you can love and I&rsquo;m hoping for the conference to help us discover and articulate what else is missing, so If you have a story to share about what in your opinion is (or isn&rsquo;t) software you can love, <a href=https://sycl.it/cfp/>there&rsquo;s an open Call for Speakers</a>.</p><p>This first year we&rsquo;ll also have a full day of Zig talks. This is done partially for practical reasons, and partially because I want the Zig community to focus on what&rsquo;s really important: <strong>making sure that your software has a positive impact on your users, and that you enjoy creating it</strong>.</p></div><hr><div id=prev-next><a href=/blog/interfacing-with-zig/>← Interfacing with Zig, a BDFL-run Project</a>
