If that sounds interesting already, you can find information about the location and ticket prices on the official website.
What does SYCL mean? Software you can love is software whose main goal is to serve the end user, and it&amp;rsquo;s alarming how rarely we get to deliver this kind of software professionally.</description></item><item><title>Interfacing with Zig, a BDFL-run Project</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/interfacing-with-zig/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/interfacing-with-zig/</guid><description>If you are interested in contributing to the ecosystem of a programming language (or any big software project really), it&amp;rsquo;s important to know its governance model and how that reflects on the community.
This might seem a boring point at first glance, especially if you just want to get to the code, but the reality is that if you don&amp;rsquo;t do this due diligence, you are setting yourself up for a lot of disappointment.</description></item><item><title>Maintain it With Zig</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/maintain-it-with-zig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/maintain-it-with-zig/</guid><description>No matter what language you program in or what applications you use: everything you do with a computer today is powered at some level by a piece of C/C++ code.</description></item><item><title>Playing the Open Source Game</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/the-open-source-game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/the-open-source-game/</guid><description>The Zig project has a non-profit foundation that needs to be managed, a community to shape, and the actual language to develop. These are all big, complex problems that don&amp;rsquo;t default to a positive outcome without active care.
Andrew did an amazing job laying the foundations, from deliberately choosing a non-profit corporate model, to picking clear values based on respect and empathy for the community to crystallize around, and finally by leading development by example both when it comes to exploring new ideas and when doing the methodical part of the work required to go from a proof of concept to a reliable tool, like zig cc, for example.</description></item><item><title>The First Zig Website Redesign</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/first-zig-website-redesign/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/first-zig-website-redesign/</guid><description>A friendlier first impression for programmers with a wider range of backgrounds.</description></item><item><title>You Should Play Secret Hitler</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/you-should-play-secret-hitler/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/you-should-play-secret-hitler/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Secret Hitler, now that everyone is playing Among Us and Among U.S.</description></item><item><title>Zig's New Relationship with LLVM</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/zig-new-relationship-llvm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/zig-new-relationship-llvm/</guid><description>While not yet at version 1.0, Zig is about to reach a new level of maturity and stability.</description></item><item><title>Addio Redis, I'm leaving Redis Labs</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/addio-redis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/addio-redis/</guid><description>Thanks Antirez for the code, the Redis manifesto, and for the free karma especially.</description></item><item><title>What is Zig's “Colorblind” Async/Await?</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/zig-colorblind-async-await/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/zig-colorblind-async-await/</guid><description>An introduction to Zig&amp;rsquo;s curious concurrent programming API.</description></item><item><title>The Upcoming Future of Online Meetups</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/future-online-meetups/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/future-online-meetups/</guid><description>As we adventure into the phase where society needs to learn to cohabit with the virus, the tech industry comes to the full realization that in-person conferences and meetups are not going to resume anytime soon. Good, but not good enough, especially when it comes to online events.
Organizers have had enough time to think it through, and yet we are still seeing many of them host what are basically extracurricular meetings.</description></item><item><title>So you're a Remote Worker Now</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/remote-worker-now/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/remote-worker-now/</guid><description>Make the most of the global remote-working experiment.</description></item><item><title>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Standup</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/good-bad-ugly-standup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/good-bad-ugly-standup/</guid><description>“In this world there are two types of standup, my friend: comedy and meetings.&lt;br/>You do meetings.”</description></item><item><title>Why Go and not Rust?</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/why-go-and-not-rust/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/why-go-and-not-rust/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s the role of Go in a universe where Rust exists?</description></item><item><title>What is Zig's Comptime?</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/what-is-zig-comptime/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/what-is-zig-comptime/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at what compile-time execution looks like in Zig.</description></item><item><title>I Want Simple, Not Just Easy</title><link>http://kristoff.it/blog/simple-not-just-easy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoff.it/blog/simple-not-just-easy/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve surely read plenty about how simple is good, but what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with easy?</description></item></channel></rss>
